# 8. Important to think about as a code reviewer

*	**Criticize code, not humans – be kind to the developer but not to the code.**  
As far as possible, write your comments in a positive spirit and focus on improving the code. Relate comment to team standards, specifications and performance increases.  

*	**Treat people who know and can do less than you with respect, reverence and patience.**  

*	**Ask questions instead of making statements.**  
A statement is accusing. "You haven't followed the standard here" is an attack whether intentional or not. The question "What was the reasoning behind this approach?” is a way of getting more knowledge. Obviously, the question cannot be said with a sarcastic or condescending tone; but if done correctly, it can get the developer to ask for a better solution.  

*	**Try to avoid "why" questions.**  
There is a big difference between "Why didn't you follow the standard here?" And "What was the reasoning behind deviating from the standard here?

*	**When proposing a change, describe why.**  

*	**Use your own examples**  
Let the developer know that he or she is not the only person who made the mistake. It can be a good way to make the criticism a little more comfortable. "I learned this the hard way when ..." or "I used to do just this way before ..." can be a good way to express oneself.  

*	**All comments do not require action.**  
Comments can also be thought-provoking and doesn’t need to be solved or even answered. But, then it is important that you note it clearly in the text.  

*	**Have you accidentally ended up as a code reviewer?**  
If you are invited to be a code reviewer and the code in question is outside your competence - comment on it in the case and remove yourself as an reviewer. If you can review parts of the code, you do so.  

*	**Remember to praise.**  
The purpose of code reviews is not to focus on telling how the developer can get better and not necessarily that they have done a good job. But human nature is such that we want to be recognized for our successes, and not be remembered because of shortcomings. Because development is a creative work that developers put their soul into, it is also close to their heart. This means that praise is needed more than criticism.  

*	**Make sure you have good code standards to refer to.**  
Auditing is based on company and industry standards. Standards aim to have a unified view to be able to produce code with quality and which is maintainable. If a discussion arises, if something that is not defined, then you have to work to add new parts. You should constantly ask yourself if what has been discussed is standardized.
But, just because it's a standard now, it doesn't have to mean that it always applies. Update standards as new methods are introduced and new frameworks etc. are released.  

*	**Remember not to rush through a code review - but, you should do it promptly.**  
Your colleagues are dependent on you and are waiting for any comments. Be sure to refuse to review if you are busy, then someone else can help out instead.
Try to go through the entire code as much as possible at once. It is to avoid many unnecessarily iteration (scrutiny, comment, change, review, comment change, etc.).  

*	**Remember that you have a responsibility for the code you are reviewing.**  
When you review a pull request and approve, you sign that you have taken your responsibility to review and ensure that the code follows the set rules.
